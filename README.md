# My Personal Portfolio Website 
Webpage I made for my CSC 409 Web Design and Programming Class
The goal was to have it in the same style and design philosophy as windows 95/98. 
Here are some of the resources I used:
1. I used this GitHub Page for a lot of my CSS: https://jdan.github.io/98.css/#field-borders
2. For the icons, I used this website: https://win98icons.alexmeub.com/
3. For the logos, I pulled the generic ones from online and then ran them through an image-to-pixel art converter: https://pixelartvillage.com/
